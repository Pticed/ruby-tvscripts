This is a collection of scripts I have written to help manage my TV show library.  They will help
you keep any library organized.  There is some scripts that are used specifically with XBMC
libraries which keep the library organized or clean out watched episodes.  Please see the specific
README files.

tvrenamer.rb - Renames TV episodes so they have the episode name in them.  Formatting is configurable.
download-status.rb - Ran via a cron, which sends a Prowl notification to a iPhone when a new file is found.
tvmover.rb - Moves files found in a single directory into the correct directory structure for tvrenamer.rb to handle.
