This script was originally written by Sam to download meta data for your TV shows.  It has been 
rewritten it to only be a fast file renamer.  It keeps a cache of all of your filenames checking
them every 10 days to see if the filename has changed.  You can force a recheck of all filenames
as well.

The name format is configurable.  Settings can be saved in a ".ruby-tvrenamer" file which is a
YML file with the following optional settings:

format

Formatting variables:
%S = Series Name
%E = Episode Name
%s = Season Number
%e = Episode Number
%p = Part Number (optional)

IMPORTANT: This script assumes you have your TV episodes in a directory structure such as
"\Show Name\Season Number\Episode"
